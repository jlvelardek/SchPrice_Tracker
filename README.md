# Coin-Hour Price Tracker
Currently, Coin-Hour price information is not available in Coinmarketcap, or CoinGecko, it is only available in the XBTS excchange. So, it becomes a tedious task to go on XBTS to track the price, and re-adjust your calculations. 

This Telegram bot scrapes the exchange's SCH ticker, and provides price data when pinged from the Telegram bot. It also uses CoinGecko's API to scrape Skycoin price, in order to do dynamic calculations for Skycoin ratios.
